	DisplayTitle		"Realism Hard 13"
	ShortDescription	"Up to 13 specials to make sure the horde deals with you."
	Description			"This is the hardest Realism Hard X mutation that works in an unmodified game. This is because Source has a default hard limit of 18 players which includes survivors, specials and tank. Any more S.I. would require kicking survivors, using a modified S.I. spawning algorithm or Metamod:Source + L4DToolZ.

The internal mode name for use in the console is rh13."
