	DisplayTitle		"Realism Hard Fourteen"
	ShortDescription	"Up to 14 specials to make sure the horde deals with you."
	Description			"This is the hardest Realism Hard X mutation that works in an unmodified game. This is because Source has a default hard limit of 18 players which includes survivors and specials. Any more S.I. would require kicking survivors or Metamod:Source + L4DToolZ."
